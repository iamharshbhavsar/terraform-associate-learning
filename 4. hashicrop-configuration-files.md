# Hashicorp Configuration Files

* HashiCorp Configuration Files (aka Terraform files) contain the configuration information about `providers` and `resources`.

* Terraform files end in the extension of `.tf` or either `.tf.json` Terraform files are written in the Terraform Language

* Terraform language consists of only a few basic elements:

    * **Blocks:** containers for other content, represent an object 
        * block type - can have zero or more labels and a body
        * block label - name of a block

    * **Arguments:** assign a value to a name
        * They appear within blocks

    * **Expressions:** represent a value, either literally or by referencing and combining other values
      * They appear as values for arguments, or within other expressions.
      <br>

>You might come across HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) this is the low-level language for both the Terraform Language and alternative JSON syntax
<br>

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" { 
  cidr_block = var.base_cidr_block 
}
```

```hcl
<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL> <BLOCK LABEL>" {
# Block body
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION> # Argument
}
```


# Alernate JSON Syntax
* Terraform also supports an *alternative syntax* that is JSON-compitable. Terraform expects JSON syntax files to be named with `.tf.json`

* This syntax is useful when generating portions of a configuration programmatically, since existing JSON libraries can be used to prepare the general configuration files.

```json
{
  "resource": { 
    "aws_instance": {
      "example": {
        "instance_type": "t2.micro",
        "ami": "ami-  abc123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Terraform Settings

* The special **terraform configuration block type** `terraform{...}` is used to configure some behaviors of Terraform itself.

* In Terraform setting we can specify:
  * `required_version`: The expected version of terraform
  *  `required_providers`: The providers that will be pull during an terraform init.
  * `experiments`: Experimental language features, that community can try and provide feedback.
  * `provider_meta`: module-specific information for providers.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      version = ">=2.7.0"
      source = "hashicrop/aws"
    }
  }
}
```
